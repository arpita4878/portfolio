              <p>During my BSc in Computer Science , the shift to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic brought unexpected challenges—but also meaningful growth. Navigating virtual classrooms taught me adaptability, self-discipline, and how to stay focused in a constantly changing environment. Academically, I built a strong foundation in core subjects like Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, C, C++, and SQL. That period not only sharpened my technical skills but also shaped my problem-solving mindset and resilience as a learner.</p>

              <p>My time in 12th grade was a formative chapter in both my academic and personal growth. It was a time of discipline, dedication, and building strong fundamentals—especially in subjects like Mathematics and Computer Science. Balancing board exam preparation with school activities taught me time management and focus. I was always curious to understand how things work, which naturally led me toward the world of programming and problem-solving. Those school years helped lay the foundation for my interest in technology and shaped the work ethic I carry with me today.</p>
